Summit Vitals: Multi-Camera and Multi-Signal Biosensing at High Altitudes

We recruited ten participants living on the Qinghai Plateau to collect hypoxia data in a real high-altitude environment. Data collection utilized two Logitech C922 cameras to capture videos of participantsâ€™ faces and fingers, along with a CMS50E+ oximeter for measur- ing PPG signals and blood oxygen levels. Respiratory patterns were monitored using an HKH-11C respiratory sensor. Video recordings were captured at a resolution of 1280x720 pixels, running at 60 frames per second. The PPG signals were recorded at a frequency of 20 Hz, while respiratory waves were captured at 50 Hz. The experiment setup is shown as follow.

The experimental process involved two sets of experiments, each with a rest state and a recovery state. In the first set, conducted in the morning, subjects wore a breathing sensor (HKH-11C) on their abdomen, an oximeter (CMS50E+) on their left index finger, and positioned their right index finger on a camera (Logitech C922). Data was recorded for three minutes during the rest state (state 1). Afterward, they performed a stair-climbing exercise, followed by another recording session (state 2) for two minutes.

The second set of experiments took place in the afternoon after subjects had fully recovered. The setup was similar, with a three-minute rest period (state 3), followed by another stair-climbing exercise. This time, during the post-exercise recording (state 4), which lasted two minutes, subjects wore portable oxygen devices.
